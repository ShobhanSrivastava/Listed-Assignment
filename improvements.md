# Areas of improvement

1. __Speed__: My speed was a bit slow and I took comparatively more time than it was required to complete the project. Maybe it was also due to the fact that I was not able to find the functions to be used in my project for gmail client. Then I took the reference from some of the python functions given in the guide. 
2. __Documentation__: I feel the documentation could have been better with deeper comments about the functions and their usage.
3. __Error handling__: The error handling could have been better. I need to learn more about error handling.
4. __Better logging__: Since I recently learned about logging, I implemented it in the project but still there is a lot more to learn about its usage to make it useful in case crashes.
5. __Need to have better understanding around authentication__: I have used Google authentication using passport but got a bit confused about its working so did waste some time there as well. 
6. __Modularity__: I feel I have decently organised and modularised the project but still there is scope of improvements in the job function.
7. __API requests__: I found myself making multiple API requests for the process which I feel, could have been reduced and there must be some better endpoints which could single handedly do the work of multiple requests. So I should have given more time to research about the APIs.
8. __Better planning__: I planned to do this project in 2 steps, authentication and then the reply automation. I planned the authentication and didn't give much attention until the very end that how it would integrate with the authentication mechanism.
9. __Random delay mechanism__: It took me a while to implement the random delay mechanism. I had some understanding around cron jobs but realised while making this project that it does not have any support for random intervals. So I realised if setTimeout can be used recursively. Spent some extra time researching and figuring to making it work.
10. __Testing__: I recently learned basics of testing like how to test functions and know the importance of testing the application and test driven development. But this was more of API work in the project so I couldn't figure how to test them and also due to time constraints.

These were the areas where I feel I could have done better. However I've taken a note of them and I'll try to improve upon them and try doing better in the future.
